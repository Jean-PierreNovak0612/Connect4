# Connect4
---
Connect4 was one of the games I loved to play in my childhood. It was a simple game where you had to be carefull and think strategic to be able to win. 
I loved the game, so I thought I'd recreate it. I added multyplayer (the two players can only play on the same device and take turns) and single player (the player will be playing against a easy difficulty AI system).
